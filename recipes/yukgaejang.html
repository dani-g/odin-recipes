    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Soak the brisket in a bowl of water and set aside for 20 minutes to draw the red liquid (myoglobin) out. Change the water a few times during this time.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the water (10 cups), brisket, onion, green onions and whole black peppercorns into a large pot. Boil them over high heat (for about 15 mins) and skim off any scum that forms. Once the water starts to rolling boil, cover the pot with the lid and reduce the heat to medium low. Continue boiling for another 45 mins. This should give you about 7.5 cups to 8 cups of broth.</p></li>
            <li><p>Take the meat out onto a plate and cool it down. Strain the remaining ingredients over a large clean bowl. Discard all the strained vegetables while keeping the broth. Once the meat is cool enough to touch, cut off any stringy fat and shred or cut the brisket into small thin strips.</p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat a large clean pot over medium low heat and once heated, add the cooking oil, sesame oil, green onions and stir.</p></li>
            <li><p>Once the green onions are wilted, add the chili powder and stir for about 30 seconds or until the chili powder absorbs all the oils. Make sure you don't burn the chili powder as it can easily happen.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the broth (from step 3), the meat, and shiitake mushrooms into the pot and boil them over medium high heat. Once it's rolling boiling, add the fernbrake, chili oil, and seasonings and reduce the heat to medium. Cover the pot with the lid and boil them for about 30 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add bean sprouts and boil for a further 10 mins.</p></li>
            <li><p>Garnish with green onions and season with salt if required. Serve with a bowl of rice, kimchi and other Korean side dishes.</p></li>
        </ol>
